# Lords of the Table

A functional Dungeon Master companion app to track notes, dice rolls, enemies and characters for the table-top
role playing game, Dungeons and Dragons.

## Description

Our project is three modules that each offer different functionality.

* Module 1. 
A dice roller module that allows the user to select what type of dice they would like to roll, 
and how many of them at a time
* Module 2. 
A notes module that allows the user to create, save, and load notes regarding events, quests, and lore within the world of Dungeons and Dragons.
* Module 3. 
A character module that allows the user to create an NPC or a monster, save that character, and add a description. This module uses the 
Open5e API to access monster lists and stats for creating characters. This module also implements a visual random character generator using the Robohash API.
